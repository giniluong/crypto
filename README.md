# Crypto Price Analysis

### Project Overview

In this project, I will analyze several cryptocurrency stocks and compare them with an S&P stock to evaluate how cryptocurrency stocks stack up against traditional stocks. The key variables under consideration will be volume, risk, return, and correlation.


### Data Source

Historical prices are sourced from Yahoo Finance, using daily adjusted closing prices. The analysis will cover the period from November 2017 to August 2024.


### Data Analysis

1) Volume
2) Daily Returns
3) Risk vs. Return
4) Correlation

### Hypothesis

The periods of 2017 and 2020-2021 are particularly noteworthy, as they marked significant surges in cryptocurrency popularity. Given the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, I anticipate that during these times, volume, risk, and returns will be exceptionally high. Following these peak periods, I expect to see a steep decline.

Since traditional stocks are generally more stable, I predict there will be minimal correlation between cryptocurrency stocks and the S&P 500.
